        <h2>The Future of the Flames</h2>
        Looking ahead, the Calgary Flames are at a pivotal moment in their franchise's history. The team has a mix of experienced players and promising young talent, setting the stage for future success. While they’ve had some recent playoff appearances, consistency remains a key focus as they work to build a more competitive roster. A major bright spot in the Flames’ future is goaltender Dustin Wolf, one of the top prospects in the NHL. Wolf, known for his impressive performances in the American Hockey League, has shown incredible promise and is expected to challenge for a spot in the NHL soon. With the leadership of general manager Craig Conroy and coach Ryan Huska, the Flames are focusing on solidifying their goaltending depth and developing young players like Wolf, who could be crucial in their quest for a Stanley Cup. Fans are hopeful that these emerging talents, along with a mix of veteran players, will help the team reach new heights in the coming seasons.
